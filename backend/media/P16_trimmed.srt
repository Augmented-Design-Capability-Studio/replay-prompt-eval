1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:06,000
And we open up the generative design study and we create a structural component.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,380
If we say that we need to preserve, well it's a good thing to set this up anyway

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:21,320
because we're gonna have to do this. We'll preserve all of these and then if

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:29,960
we tell it that we need to design structural constraints and we're gonna

5
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,440
say that let's so let's see what happens if we say that all of these are fixed.

6
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,960
Oh right it's faces that I'm selecting okay let me think about that then. Well

7
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,160
so the ones that we need to design as fixed then are going to be this face

8
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:57,480
here, this face here, this face here. I guess we can leave this one floating.

9
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:07,560
I mean I'll see if I if I design this one as fixed as well. What will happen?

10
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,720
Okay so we've got those fixed we're not gonna assign any obstacle geometry for a

11
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:19,520
second. We can set the objectives that we're trying to minimize mass. We'll set

12
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:28,280
the factor of safety of two for now. And then I don't I don't know if I need to

13
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:34,000
set manufacturing or materials to do that sort of previewer but I'll just do

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,360
it just to be safe. Let's say we're doing additive and milling and not

15
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:47,560
unrestricted okay and we have materials let's just put it in one material for

16
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:54,560
now just so that we have it we'll put in just a like an aluminum close that up

17
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:02,160
okay so we've set the preserve geometry we didn't set any obstacle geometry our

18
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:08,520
objectives your manufacturing we have that we didn't add loads let's add in

19
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:19,120
some loads just for fun let's say that on this face on this face and on this

20
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,240
face and on

21
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:33,600
I guess we can select the top face here and let's say that let's say they're

22
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,480
just splitting the load evenly for right now even though that's probably not what

23
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:44,880
is happening so 1250 kilograms so I should be able to do that math but I'm

24
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,680
just gonna pull the calculator to make my life easier

25
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:57,640
I mean okay divided by four all right 3062.5 Newton's okay

26
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:08,440
all right okay so theoretically the pre check says that's all good cool okay

27
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,360
we're not gonna generate we're just gonna go to the previewer we'll see what

28
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:20,240
happens now when we have basically the preserves geometry and the fixed and the

29
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,320
loads set where they are right now

30
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:45,240
interesting so it looks like it is building material

31
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:50,680
it's gonna build it looks like it's building some material underneath so we

32
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:56,000
might want to make a body underneath this to just specify hey don't like

33
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,960
build in this space in fact is it actually interesting is it building

34
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:10,440
inside of this as well it is okay so we're gonna have to specify some things

35
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:17,000
inside of these you know when you have a moment okay give me one second I'm just

36
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,680
still kind of observing the preview

37
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:28,080
yeah okay so we're gonna have to add in some extra body is just to specify some

38
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:34,920
obstacles but the rest of it looks fine from a previous standpoint so I'm not

39
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:41,640
super concerned about that yet okay I am free what did you want to ask me about

40
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:46,800
what are your assumptions for the obstacle geometry my assumptions for the

41
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,640
obstacle geometry are that I need to the only things I care about are preserving

42
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:57,920
the connections at the bra at the of the bracket so the connection at the damper

43
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:04,520
the connection at the engine connectors those need to be free of material

44
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:10,080
essentially we don't want material to generate inside of those because then we

45
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:16,720
won't be able to place our connectors and our bolts inside so that is my main

46
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,600
assumption and then as we sort of regenerate previews we can see if

47
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:29,120
there's other areas where maybe we need to remove we need to specify more bodies

48
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,360
to remove material from or things like that

49
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:48,160
okay sounds good just off of that actually then what I'll do for now will

50
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,120
look at least we've set up a preliminary study you know we can come back

51
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,200
afterwards once we kind of see
