1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,000
Here.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,040
And then finally we have

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:11,800
that connection to the damper.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:18,840
Somewhere around here. Doesn't need to be drawn to scale or anything like that.

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,300
Just trying to get a general sense as to where to apply the loading conditions.

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,300
So,

7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,640
essentially we have

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,240
the engine

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,940
kind of off over here.

10
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,340
Right.

11
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:43,040
And so the engine weight is just, you know, if we just modeled it as a point mass, it's just

12
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,440
going like that right now.

13
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,340
And so the reactions we'd expect are

14
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,340
that we're getting

15
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,640
in our system, we'd expect that there'd be

16
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,440
probably

17
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,440
forces being applied here.

18
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,140
Forces being applied on the second one.

19
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:12,140
And force being applied here.

20
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:16,140
And one force being applied here.

21
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,840
Because that needs to be sitting on the damper, so there's going to be some amount of force

22
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,340
that is, that it's going to carry there. So,

23
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,940
we can start with four forces. I wonder,

24
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,140
I mean, so if we have four forces,

25
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,640
we're not going to have, we should be fine

26
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:45,840
from a condition, like a boundary condition sort of

27
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,640
perspective. It should be solvable because we'll have the moment equations

28
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,040
theoretically to help us solve out like what's going on

29
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,540
everywhere so we could work out what,

30
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:02,740
you know, what force is going to be applied everywhere, but it should also be

31
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:08,240
something that we can design actually for and figure out, you know, maybe we,

32
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,940
maybe with this free body diagram, what we want to do right is we want to figure out

33
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:19,940
what forces are being applied where, what moments are being applied and stuff like that and then apply

34
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:26,340
that using the knowledge we can gain from the free body diagram. So,

35
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,740
let's maybe...

36
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:33,140
I want to ask you a couple of questions that might help you think through the design task.

37
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,840
Go for it.

38
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,040
What are your assumptions for the structural constraints?

39
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,840
My assumptions for the structural constraints are that

40
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,340
we are going to have

41
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:53,440
assumptions for the constructional constraints.

42
00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:05,940
Can you define what you mean by constructional constraints?

43
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,740
Give me a second.

44
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:17,740
While that's going I'll just think a bit more about this.

45
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:22,040
Constructional constraints.

46
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,040
Mm-hmm.

47
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:33,040
Apply those forces there.

48
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:40,040
We also have to think about what we're going to model.

49
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,040
The solver requires structural loads and structural constraints.

50
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,040
What are your assumptions for the structural constraints?

51
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:51,840
Well, my assumptions right now for the structural constraints is that, you know,

52
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,840
in the most basic case, if I just wanted to get jump right into designing it, is that I would need to apply

53
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:06,840
forces on most of these structure, on basically all of the connection points, and then I would need to model

54
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:16,840
the bracket connections as fixed connections, and I would want to model the damper as

55
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,840
I guess it could technically...

56
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:25,840
I mean it's sitting on there, but it's also screwed in, so I would also model that as a fixed connection, I believe,

57
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:34,840
because it's this actual piece that's going to be kind of damping everything out and potentially moving,

58
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:40,840
and this shouldn't be moving, this connection shouldn't be moving, so I would model every connection as fixed.

59
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:46,840
So that's kind of the... those are the assumptions I'm running with currently.

60
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,840
What alternative assumptions might we make about the load case?

61
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:58,840
Alternative assumptions... well we might need to apply, depending on how I want to solve out this sort of free body diagram,

62
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:07,840
we might need to apply some moments or other loads that we might not be expecting.

63
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:18,840
You could, I guess, model the connection at the damper as potentially a pin so that it can slide,

64
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:29,840
but I... and then say that it's just not really carrying any force, but I don't think that would be accurate to the situation,

65
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:38,840
but we can see depending on how the design generates, if that is kind of a valid concern or not.

66
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:49,840
Okay, what will the solver when we specify all preserved bodies as fixed constraints?

67
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,840
What would... can you repeat the question?

68
00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:00,840
Okay, what will the solver do when we specify all preserved bodies as fixed constraints?

69
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:10,840
All preserved bodies as fixed constraints... what would the solver do if we defined all of the bodies as fixed constraints?

70
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:15,840
That is a good question, I do not know.

71
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,840
I guess we can go and check and see really quickly.

72
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:29,840
So if we go into the software here and we open up the Generate Design Study and we create a structural component,

73
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:38,840
if we say that we need to preserve... well it's a good thing to set this up anyway because we're going to have to do this.

74
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:52,840
We'll preserve all of these and then if we tell it that we need to design structural constraints,

75
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,840
and we're going to say that... so let's see what happens if we say that all of these are fixed.

76
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,840
Oh right, it's faces that I'm selecting. Okay, let me think about that then.

77
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:18,840
Well, so the ones that we need to design as fixed then are going to be this face here, this face here, this face here...

78
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:25,840
I guess we can leave this one floating.

79
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:32,840
I mean, I'll see if I design this one as fixed as well.

80
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:38,840
So we've got those fixed, we're not going to assign any obstacle geometry for a second.

81
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:48,840
We can set the objectives that we're trying to minimize mass, we'll set a factor of safety of two for now.

82
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:58,840
And then I don't know if I need to set manufacturing or materials to do that sort of previewer, but I'll just do it just to be safe.

83
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:04,840
Let's say we're doing additive and milling, not unrestricted, okay.

84
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:12,840
And we have materials, let's just put in one material for now just so that we have it.

85
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:19,840
We'll put in just like an aluminum, close that up, okay.

86
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,840
So we've set the preserved geometry, we didn't set any obstacle geometry.

87
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,840
We have our objectives, we have manufacturing, we have...

88
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,840
Ah, we didn't add loads.

89
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,840
Let's add in some loads just for fun.

90
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:50,840
Let's say that on this face, on this face, and on this face, and on...

91
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,840
I guess we can select the top face here.

92
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,840
And let's say that...

93
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:02,840
Let's say they're just splitting the load evenly for right now, even though that's probably not what is happening.

94
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:12,840
So 1250 kilograms, so I should be able to do that math, but I'm just going to pull up a calculator to make my life easier.

95
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:24,840
E, K divided by 4, alright, 30,062.5 Newtons, okay.

96
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,840
Alright, okay.

97
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,840
So theoretically the pre-check says that's all good, cool, okay.

98
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,840
We're not going to generate, we're just going to go to the previewer.

99
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:47,840
We'll see what happens now when we have basically the preserved geometry and the fixed and the loads set where they are right now.

100
00:09:47,840 --> 00:10:02,840
Interesting.

101
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:10,840
So it looks like it is building material...

102
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:21,840
It looks like it's building some material underneath, so we might want to make a body underneath this to just specify, hey, don't build in this space.

103
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:30,840
In fact, is it? Actually, interesting, is it building inside of this as well? It is.

104
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:35,840
Okay, so we're going to have to specify some things inside of these.

105
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,840
Hey, let me know when you have a moment.

106
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:43,840
Okay, give me one second, I'm just still kind of observing the preview.

107
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,840
Um...

108
00:10:46,840 --> 00:11:01,840
Yeah, okay, so we're going to have to add in some extra bodies just to specify some obstacles, but the rest of it looks fine from a preview standpoint, so I'm not super concerned about that yet.

109
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:09,840
Okay, I am free, what did you want to ask me about?

110
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:28,840
My assumptions for the obstacle geometry are that I need to... the only things I care about are preserving the connections of the bracket, so the connection at the damper, the connection at the engine connectors, those need to be free of material, essentially.

111
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:40,840
We don't want material to generate inside of those, because then we won't be able to place our connectors, our bolts inside, so that is my main assumption.

112
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:57,840
And then as we sort of regenerate previews, we can see if there's other areas where maybe we need to remove... we need to specify more bodies to remove material from, or things like that.

113
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:07,840
Okay, sounds good.

114
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:18,840
Um, just off of that actually then, what I'll do for now, we'll... at least we've set up a preliminary study, you know, we can come back afterwards once we kind of see...
